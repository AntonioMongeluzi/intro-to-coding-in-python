# Antonio M. Mongeluzi
# Final Project Preposal

# For my final project I would like to take advantage of the double dipping from
# another class (Mathematical Concepts in Computing) and do my final project
# based off of a prompt given in that class.  The prompt I am interested in is
# an apportionment problem on how to fairly divide discrete objects.
# The class has already made it clear what they want to divide, however, I would
#use what I learned from this class and the other to do something different for
# this classes final project.

# I am planning on working alone, and will get permission from both professors
# before the proposal is due.

# My question is in regards to what could be something interesting to do with
# this concept from my mathematics class.  Any cool recommendations?
