#Work Schedule using apportionment

#I have been learning how to use different apportionment equations in python and
#taking what I learn to decide which is the best for my final project.
#Have also been working out how to open data that is input into a program
#in a spread sheet.

#I have not figured date configurations for my code.

#No big problems yet, just deciding which apportionment method I think will work
#best.
